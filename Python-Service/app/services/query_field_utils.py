"""
Guarantees a SELECT query actually returns every field the UI has mapped,
even when the query text itself only lists a subset of them (hand-typed, or
auto-generated from just a couple of sample fields).

Without this, a field that's mapped in the UI but NOT in the query's own
SELECT list comes back completely empty in the extracted/previewed data --
silently, with no error, because the CRM was simply never asked for it. The
query editor is meant to control filtering (WHERE) and which extra columns
to eyeball; it was never meant to be able to silently cap what data actually
ends up in the migration. So the SELECT list a user (or the frontend's
auto-generated default query) writes is treated as a MINIMUM they can
narrow the WHERE clause around, not a ceiling on what gets fetched.

Both the live-preview path (crm_query_service.py) and every CRM's
extraction path (salesforce_migrator.py, zoho_migrator.py) call into this
so the preview table and the actual migration always agree on what data
shows up for a given set of mappings.
