"""
Single source of truth for turning the UI's `migrationTimeFilter` payload
into a CRM-specific WHERE/COQL clause fragment, and for merging that clause
into an existing query string.

Both the live-preview path (crm_query_service.py) and every CRM's extraction
path (salesforce_migrator.py, zoho_migrator.py) import from here instead of
keeping their own copy of this logic in sync by hand. Any future change --
a new CRM, a different default field, inclusive/exclusive boundary handling,
timezone handling, or reintroducing a relative mode -- only has to be made
in this one file.

Only `mode: "range"` (explicit startDate/endDate) is supported. Relative
filtering (LAST_N_DAYS / LAST_N_MONTHS / LAST_N_YEARS) has been removed.
The range can be open-ended on the "To" side only: a `startDate` with no
`endDate` defaults the end to the caller's current local date; an `endDate`
with no `startDate` is rejected (see `_parse_date_range`).

Salesforce and Zoho both filter on an absolute instant (a datetime literal),
so their builders apply `utcOffsetMinutes` to convert the caller's local
calendar day into the correct UTC instant. Zendesk's Search API resolves
plain YYYY-MM-DD date literals using the account's own time zone (it isn't
given an instant at all), so `build_zendesk_time_clause` intentionally skips
the offset math -- shifting it would double-convert the boundary. HubSpot
needs the same absolute-instant treatment as Salesforce/Zoho, just expressed
as epoch milliseconds instead of a literal string.

    Extracts (field, start_dt, end_dt) from a migrationTimeFilter payload.

    Returns None when no filter should be applied (filter absent, or an
    unsupported/legacy `mode` such as the old 'relative' -- treated as
    "no filter" rather than an error so a stale cached frontend build
    degrades gracefully instead of hard-failing mid-rollout).

    The range can be open-ended on the "To" side: if only `startDate` is
    given, `endDate` defaults to the caller's current local date (using
    `utcOffsetMinutes`) -- "From Jan 1" quietly means "from Jan 1 through
    today" rather than forcing the user to type in today's date by hand.
    The reverse isn't allowed: `endDate` alone with no `startDate` raises,
    since "everything up to X" isn't a range this filter can express (every
    builder here ANDs two bounds together, so there's no sentinel meaning
    "unbounded start").

    `utcOffsetMinutes` (optional, defaults to 0/UTC) shifts the calendar-day
    boundaries so "Jan 1" means midnight in the caller's local timezone
    rather than midnight UTC -- otherwise a record modified in the last few
    hours of a local day can fall outside the range because the day
    boundary was computed in UTC. Positive values are ahead of UTC (e.g.
    India = +330). Pass `apply_offset=False` for a target (like Zendesk)
    whose API already resolves plain date literals in the account's own
    time zone -- applying the offset there would shift the boundary twice.
    The offset is still read (and validated) even when apply_offset=False,
    since it's also used to compute "today" for the open-ended-range default
    above, which should reflect the caller's local day regardless of how
    the target CRM consumes the resulting literal.

    Raises TimeFilterError when a range filter IS present but incomplete
    or invalid, so the caller can surface a real 400 instead of silently
    ignoring bad input.
